This repository contains models built on [Bank Marketing Data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) available from UCI ML repository. The classification goal is to predict wheather a customer will accept the 'CD' (Certificate of Deposit) offer based on various customer related and previous campaign related data.

The real motivation to study this particular problem is show the end-to-end pipeline features of the **sklearn** library. 'sklearn' is a remarkably well designed library which let's one quickly prototype a data flow pipeline and test a variety of machine learning models, by chaining a set of *Estimators*, *Transformers*, and *Predictors*.

Among the machine learning models that were tested on this particular dataset, not surprisingly, Light Gradient Boosting framework produced the best results. **Gini=0.87**
